# üöÄ Chatbot Response System

## üìñ Project Overview
I structured the project as follows:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Classification**
3. **Chatbot Development**
4. **Deployment on AWS**

To gather the necessary data, I developed a script to scrape the entire Promtior website, extracting as much information as possible. Interestingly, this process led me to discover hidden sections of the website that should not be publicly accessible, which could be useful to present as a finding.

After collecting and classifying the data, I proceeded to develop the chatbot. Integrating it with FastAPI for web usage was relatively straightforward. I assumed that a graphical interface was not required, as there was no mention of it in the provided documentation.

My primary focus was on the **information quality**. Notably, the company's foundation year was missing from the website, so I manually added it to the database to ensure completeness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Main Challenges & Solutions
- **Getting a free trial for Azure** ‚Üí I couldn't resolve this, so I opted for AWS instead.
- **Library compatibility issues with Docker** ‚Üí Successfully resolved.
- **Opening ports in AWS** ‚Üí Managed to open a port for the server to respond, achieving a successful deployment.

## üìå API Deployment
